Interactive Leaflet map example using Angular for client side and C# ASP.NET Core for server side. This uses data from 2022 crop census, Disaster Designation Information Made By the US Secretary of Agriculture, Presidential Emergency Declarations, USFS fire occurance data all linked together in a clean interactive web map at county & state level. Fire geo points are converted to circle makers with pop up details. County and state polygons also have popup details details. 

- Project uses data that was pulled from USDA from 2018 to mid 2025: 
  - https://www.fsa.usda.gov/resources/disaster-assistance-program/disaster-designation-information
  - USDA quick stats
- I have Angular client and ASP.NET C# server applications hosted on Azure, public link below:
